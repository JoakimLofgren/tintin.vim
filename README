TinTin++ is a free mud client that runs on the Windows, Linux, and Mac OSX platforms.

if can be found here: http://tintin.sourceforge.net/ 

contains syntax for commands, color codes, comments, braces, quotes, and variables cmd separators, although this is pretty average, and doesnt do nearly as much as i want it to do. 

for a better version, check this out http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2135
